# Kaggle
This repo contains solutions/approach to challenges listed on https://www.kaggle.com/. 
Below each problem, I have listed some important concepts/lessons encountered.

#### I. Digit Recognizer - The famous MNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

- Implementation of basic ML models (SVM, RF, kNN)
- Deep CNNs with Dropout, BatchNormalization, data augmentation (Keras with Theano backend)

#### II. Mercedes Benz - Predict time spent on test bench (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing)

- Handling high-dimensional, anonymized data (PCA)
- Building models robust to overfitting (Feature selection, regularization etc.)

#### III. Porto Seguro - Predict if insurance claim will be filed (https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction)

- Target encoding of high-cardinality categorical variables
- Custom eval metric function
- Ensembles of different kinds of GBM models with cross-validation
- Mixed sampling (upsampling+downsampling) to counter imbalanced classification problem
